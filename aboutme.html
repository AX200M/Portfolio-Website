        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>My Name Is Evangelos Colombus, I am a 17 year old College Student who is studying Games Programming at ACM College ( UK ) .</p>
        <p>For a long time I have always wanted to be a programmer.
            I have always loved the idea of being able to program things that I need, when I need them.
            Even though my primary focus is programming, I am trying to learn different things to be able to have a variety of knowledge and expertise. </p>
        <h3>During my spare time I have managed to learn:</h3>

        <li>Unity 3D & 2D - Learned all about the game engine, how to use it, optimisation, implementing and using the animator, creating animations, implementing 3D models etc.</li>
        <li>Website Development ( Shopify, Squarespace etc ) - I have created Websites that are consistent with the customers want and intent, implementing e-commerce, adding products, managing customers etc.</li>
